Roll The Dice Game 
A Real game which you can play with a friends. So if you roll the dice, the number will be added to your current score and if you want to hold that score then your current score will be added to total score and will switch to next player. The rule of the game is if you get 1 then your current score will be zero and its next players turn. Now the player with score more than or equal to maxVal will win. maxVal in our case is 20 but we can change.
